You cant use express in cloudflare workers as express heavily relies on node js and its dependencies but workers dont run on node js runtime. 

Methods to use express -> 
* Either use differant libraries . Eg- Hono / Lukeed / Worktop etc
* You can split all your handlers in a file
Create a generic handler that you can forward requests to from either express or hono or native cloudflare handler

For ex - Adding the function to find a user using the mongoose library in user.ts 
and writing other function in express router or cloudflare router

* Using HONO -> 
* npm create hono@latest my-app
* now you will get a basic boiler plate code of hono 
In hono you you can use one parameter ( c ) for both req and res tasks. 
For giving response use c.text or c.json
