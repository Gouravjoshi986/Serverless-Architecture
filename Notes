# Servers are used to host a web app. 
you write backends in express and deploy it somewhere on the internet 
the most used servers today are AWS GCP Azure etc. 
in these type of servers you rent out a VM and auto scale your code on it. 

But it comes with a fixed cost even if no one visits your website. 
Auto scaling is problematic.
third problem is Monitoring various servers to make sure no server is down .

# Serverless Backe
it means that the developer doesnt have to worry about the server. 
The cloud operater will dynamically allocates and manages servers.

On writing the code(routes) automatically deploys scales and charge you on per request basis 
# Problem = Very expensive to scale ( high charge on per request at bigger scale)
            Cold start problem --> the first request after no activity faces high latency 


# There are many famous backend serverless providers -
