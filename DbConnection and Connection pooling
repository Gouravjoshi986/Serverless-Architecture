connecting to a database in a serverless env is hard as a serverless env will have a large amount of workers working seperately and all of these workers wil try to form a connection with the database , this will lead to breaching of the maximum no of allowed connections to db.   

To tackle this problem we developed an architecture known as connection pool. 
we will connect many workers to a pool. 
that single pool will then connect with the db.

Steps : 
a.   Create a new worker for cloudflare npm create cloudflare@latest 
b.   create a prisma file using    npm i --save-dev prisma 
c.   npx prisma init 
d.   get your connection string of database that you want to use and store it in .env file 
e.   Go to prisma accelerate and enable accelerate to create a connection pool and generate its connection string.   
f.  Insert this connection string as your url string in prisma schema and add it to wrangler.toml file as DATABASE_URL="....." . this is a connection pool connected with your db 
g.   Now add your direct url also to prisma schema to aid in migrations etc (optional)
